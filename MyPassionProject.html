        <p>Hi I'm Molly! I'm from Atlanta, Georgia and I really like Barnard
        and NYC! It's a ton of fun living here- basically I just eat constantly. 
        <span class='pinktext'> I've ordered Insomnia probably three times already this semester. </span>
        Oh yeah, that's something I'm passionate about- FOOD. I just
        really like food. and Netflix. I spend a lot of time on Netflix. I've
        seen pretty much every food/wine/culinary documentary that's on
        netflix.</p>
